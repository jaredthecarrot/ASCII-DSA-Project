Stack: Used for the dungeon crawling. Popping stack puts you into deeper part of dungeon. Validation for victory screen. Supplementary to the graph ADT
and the DFS uses the runtime stack using recursion.
Queue: Used for the player and enemy turns. Popping queue puts you into next turn.
Dictionary: Used for player inventory. Prints at the start of player creation.
Graph: Represents the rooms of the dungeon with vertices. DFS prints the rooms after delving deeper into each dungeon.

Limitations: Decided not to go for the graphical interface route due to complexity, time constraints, and
the unnecessity of it.

How to play: Very straight forward. Following the prompts will get you through the game. Traversal of the dungeon is automatic.
